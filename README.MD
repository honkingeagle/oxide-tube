# About the project

This is yet another youtube downloader ðŸ˜´.

It is especially customized for my use case for downloading videos where there is limited internet connectivity.

The cli tool is hard coded to download 720p videos.

Why?.

I/we probably don't need to download videos of higher resolution (with limited internet connectivity) but at the same time, videos with a resolution lower than 720p are a bit blurry. Its a fine line.

# Improvements to make

Asking the user which resolution they would want.

# Getting started

To get started, download the above binary:

`oxide-tube`

To execute the binary, type `./oxide-tube --help` in the current folder.

You could choose to write the path to .bashrc (or use whatever way your OS lets you write environment variables).

You could also add the binary to your `/usr/bin` directory.
